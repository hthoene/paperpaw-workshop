### Marks (decorations)

A plugin marks words on book pages with a decorator (ADR 0021): it gets
the words of a page with their places in the book and gives back ranges,
each with a *role*. The reader draws them; the plugin knows neither the
reader nor the panel.

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::decorations::{self, Decorated, Decoration, DecoratorSpec, LineKind};

const LEARNING: Id = Id::new_static("vocabulary.learning");

// The role: its look is settings (Settings, Marks), the
// plugin gives the default; themes and users change it.
decorations::add_role(r, &LEARNING, "vocabulary.role.learning",
    Decoration::NONE.line(LineKind::Dotted))?;
r.add_decorator(
    DecoratorSpec::new(Id::new_static("vocabulary.words"), "vocabulary.decorator",
        |env, page| {
            page.words
                .iter()
                .filter(|w| is_learnt(env, w.text))
                .filter_map(|w| Decorated::words(core::slice::from_ref(w), &LEARNING))
                .collect()
        })
    .switch(&MARK)          // a bool setting turns it on and off
    .taps()                 // taps on its marks come back
    .signature(|env| words_changed(env)),
)?;
r.on(events::DECORATION_TAPPED, |env, tapped, out| { /* tapped.text */ })?;
```

- A `Decoration` is a background, the text's ink, a line under the text
  (solid, dotted, dashed, wavy, double) with its tone and thickness, a
  frame, struck through; tones are named, and each panel shows them as
  well as it can (colours, or their lightness, dithered where there are
  few grays).
- Each aspect of a role is a setting of its own (`<role>.background`,
  `.ink`, `.line`, `.line-tone`, `.thickness`, `.frame`, `.struck`), so
  profiles, rules and themes set them like any other.
- Decorators are asked once a page is laid out, and again when their
  signature changes (their data, their settings): keep it cheap, and
  never work on a whole book.
- Where marks meet on a word, the earlier decorator (by `order`) wins an
  aspect both set; the rest combine.
- The reader's own marks are roles too: `roles::HIGHLIGHT`, `LINK`,
  `SEARCH_HIT`, `ALOUD`. A reader of one's own draws all marks with
  `decorations::draw_behind` and `draw_over`.
- What changes widths (bold, a larger size) is a text filter instead: it
  lays the page out again.

Words found by patterns need no code of one's own:
`decorations::PatternDecorator` marks what its patterns
(`paperpaw_sdk::pattern`, a small part of regular expressions: classes,
`\b`, repeats, `|`, groups, `(?i)`, with bounded work) find on the page's
text, each in its role:

```rust
let names = PatternDecorator::new()
    .rule(Pattern::new(r"\b(?:Mr|Mrs|Miss)\. [A-Z]\w+").unwrap(), NAME)
    .into_spec(Id::new_static("tale.names"), "tale.names");
r.add_decorator(names)?;
```

A plugin without code does the same with a `marks.ini`, a section per
role (`<plugin>.<section>`), its patterns and its look:

```ini
[names]
title = Names
pattern = \b(?:Mr|Mrs|Miss)\. [A-Z]\w+
background = yellow
line = wavy
```

Any plugin can read the words of the page shown, not only decorators:
`reading::ask_page_words(&MY_WORDS)` asks the reader, which answers with
the event `MY_WORDS`, a `reading::PageWords` (the book, the page's start
and end, its words with their places).
