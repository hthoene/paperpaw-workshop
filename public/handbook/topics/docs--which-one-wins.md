### Which one wins

- **Slots.** The screen the user chose in `[slots]` (*Screens*,
  above); else the binding
  with the highest `Priority` (`FALLBACK`, `DEFAULT`, `PREFERRED`, or
  any number); between equal priorities, the one registered later,
  that is of the plugin loaded later.
- **Key bindings.** A later source overrides an earlier one for the
  same button or gesture: the plugins' `add_keymap`, in the order the
  plugins load; then their `add_keymap_when` while its switch is on, so
  these override the plugins' plain bindings; then the device's, the
  preset the user chose, and the user's own `[keymap.*]`. A plugin's
  binding never overrides the device's, the preset's or the user's.
- **Menus.** Entries in their `order`, equal orders in the order they
  were added; a menu the user redefined in their order, with entries
  contributed since after their neighbour.
