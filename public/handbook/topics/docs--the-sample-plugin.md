## The sample plugin

[`samples/hello-plugin`](../samples/hello-plugin/src/lib.rs) is a small
plugin to start from. It adds *Hello* to the tools menu, which opens a
screen greeting you by a name set in the settings, with the number of
books opened since the start. Try it in the emulator:

```sh
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator --features hello -- --profile boox-go-7 --set hello.name=Ada
```

Open the main menu (a tap at the bottom of the home screen), then
*Tools*, then *Hello*.

### The plugin

A plugin is a type implementing [`Plugin`]: a manifest and a `register`
function. `register` runs once at start-up and adds the plugin's
contributions through a [`Registrar`]:

```rust
pub const PLUGIN: Id = Id::new_static("hello");
pub const OPEN: Id = Id::new_static("hello.open");
pub const SCREEN: Id = Id::new_static("hello.screen");

pub struct Hello;

impl Plugin for Hello {
    fn manifest(&self) -> Manifest {
        Manifest::new(PLUGIN, "Hello", Version::new(0, 1, 0))
            .description("A sample plugin to start from.")
            .uses(paperpaw_sdk::Uses::NOTHING)
    }

    fn register(&self, r: &mut Registrar) -> Result<(), RegisterError> {
        r.add_action(ActionSpec::new(OPEN, "hello.title").handler(|_, out| {
            out.push(Command::OpenScreen(SCREEN, Params::new()));
        }))?;
        r.add_menu_entry(MenuEntry::new(menus::TOOLS, OPEN).order(90))?;
        r.add_icon(OPEN, Cow::Borrowed("star"))?;
        // … the screen, a setting, an event, translations
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Every id starts with the plugin's id (`hello.open`); `core` is the
kernel's. Titles are translation keys, translated where they are shown.

Icons are named as in [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), any of
them (`paperpaw_sdk::icons` knows every name). PaperPaw's icon font holds
the ones it uses itself; for another, bring its drawing as an icon pack
(see below), else none shows.

### Reading and changing: `Env` and commands

Plugins never change the kernel's state directly. They read it through
[`Env`]: the device, the settings, the translations, the fonts, the
storage, the time, the battery, the passwords and keys. They change it
with [`Command`]s: open a screen or slot, go back, change a setting,
emit an event, run an action, show a short message, make an HTTP
request, keep a password, and so on. The kernel runs the commands after
the plugin's code returns.

This keeps plugins simple to test and the API message-based, so the same
model works for sandboxed plugins later.

### Screens

A screen implements [`Screen`]. `draw` paints it; `on_action` reacts to
actions (from buttons, or gestures bound to them); `on_gesture` to taps,
long presses and swipes; `on_event` to events while it is open:

```rust
impl Screen for HelloScreen {
    fn draw(&mut self, canvas: &mut Canvas<'_>, env: &Env<'_>) {
        let title = env.i18n.tr("hello.title");
        self.header.draw(canvas, env, &self.style, title, None, None);
        // … the greeting, centred below
    }

    fn on_action(&mut self, action: &Id, cx: &mut Cx<'_, '_>) -> Handled {
        if *action == actions::CONFIRM || *action == actions::BACK {
            cx.command(Command::Back);
            return Handled::Yes;
        }
        Handled::No
    }

    fn on_gesture(&mut self, gesture: Gesture, cx: &mut Cx<'_, '_>) -> Handled {
        // A tap on the header's back arrow, or anywhere else, closes it.
    }
}
```

Screens are made by a factory each time they open
(`r.add_screen(ScreenSpec::new(id, title, factory))`). Return
`Handled::No` for what a screen does not handle: the kernel then runs
the action's own handler (e.g. the menu button opens the menu).

Some rules every screen should follow:

- **Touch and buttons alike.** Some devices have only buttons (the
  Xteink X4), some mostly touch (the Boox). Everything must be easy with
  either: buttons move a focus and confirm, taps act at once. Show the
  focus only once buttons are used (`ListView::focus_on_keys`).
- **`draw` only draws.** On small devices a frame is drawn in bands
  (the X4 draws five), so `draw` runs several times for one frame, and
  again for every frame after it: whatever it reads or works out, it
  does over and over. Load what a screen shows when it opens or when
  that changes (in its factory, `on_show`, `on_event`); parse it, sort
  it, wrap long texts and make pictures small (`ui::Thumbnail`) then,
  keep the result in the screen, and only draw it in `draw`, which must
  not change state. It can skip what lies outside `canvas.clip()`. The
  one thing read while drawing is a picture too large to keep, such as
  one filling the screen: `ui::draw_image` reads its rows band by band.
  The emulator's `--trace` shows what each band of a frame reads;
  `crates/paperpaw-app/tests/draw.rs` checks every screen of the
  standard app.
- **Ask for redraws.** After a change, `cx.request_redraw()` (or a part
  of the screen) and `cx.request_refresh(mode)`: `Fast` for a moving
  focus, `Partial` for new content, `Full` to clear ghosting.
- **Overlays** are screens with a `region`. One that takes the reader's
  attention (a menu, a question) washes out what lies below it
  (`dims_below`); one looked through (a keyboard over the field it
  types into, a notice) does not. A screen whose content is best in
  grays (a picture) says so (`grays`): panels with few grays then show
  it in more, as slowly as a full refresh.
- **Use the SDK's UI parts** (`paperpaw_sdk::ui`): headers, rows, lists,
  switches, numbers with − and +, messages, icons. They follow the user's
  appearance settings and line up with the rest of PaperPaw. What a
  screen draws itself takes its look from `UiStyle`: the focus with
  `ui::draw_focus`, what is on a focused row in `style.focus_ink(focused)`
  (white on the dark bar, black on a frame or a light bar), small shapes
  with `style.radius(height)` (pills where corners are round), boxes and
  cards with `style.corner`, lines between rows with `ui::draw_separator`.

Screens say what they show, for reading the interface aloud,
automation and tests: the `ui` helpers (list rows, buttons, switches,
headers, labels) tell what they draw by themselves. A screen that draws
in its own way tells it with `canvas.describe(role, text, area,
focused, on)`, with the role of what it is (`Row`, `Button`, `Switch`,
`Check`, `Radio`, `Field`, `Image`, `Link`, `Dialog`, `Progress` …). A
screen reader of one's own hears where the focus of the buttons goes
(`events::FOCUS_CHANGED`: its role, label and area).

### Settings

A setting is a constant with its id and the type of its value
(`Setting<bool>`, `Setting<i64>` or `Setting<Text>` for choices,
languages, lists and text):

```rust
pub const NAME: Setting<Text> = Setting::new("hello.name");

r.add_setting(
    SettingSpec::text(&NAME, "hello.setting.name", "")
        .group(groups::OTHER)
        .description("hello.setting.name.help"),
)?;

let name: &str = env.settings.read(&NAME);
out.push(Command::set(&NAME, "Ada".into()));
```

`SettingSpec::switch`, `number`, `choice`, `language`, `list` and
`text` make the others, their defaults of the setting's type. The
settings screens list every setting by its group, with its description
below it; the kernel saves changes to `paperpaw.ini`. Settings can be
numbers with units and steps, switches, choices, languages or text;
`advanced()` hides rarely needed ones, `scoped()` lets one be set per
book, `editor(screen)` opens a screen of your own instead. Settings
known only at run time (one per widget, say) are read by their ids,
`env.settings.text("…")` and so on. Passwords and keys do not belong in
settings: see [Passwords and keys](#passwords-and-keys).

Each setting built this way takes about 200 bytes while the device
runs. A plugin with many settings keeps them in the program instead, in
a `static` list (on the X4 it stays in flash, next to no memory):

```rust
const GROUP: Id = Id::new_static("hello.clock");
static SETTINGS: [SettingSpec; 2] = [
    SettingSpec::fixed_switch("hello.clock.date", "hello.setting.date", true, GROUP),
    SettingSpec::fixed_choice("hello.clock.face", "hello.setting.face",
        &["hello.face.plain", "hello.face.ticks"], "hello.face.ticks", GROUP)
        .described("hello.setting.face.help"),
];

r.add_settings(&SETTINGS)?;
```

Such settings are read like any other; those that need a unit, a step,
a section or an editor screen are made as above.

A setting may show only while another has a value
(`SettingExtra::shown_if("hello.sync", "on")`, the server's address
while syncing is on), and check a value before it is set
(`SettingExtra::check(fn)`): a value it refuses is not set, and the
reader is told the translation of the key it returns. Screens of your
own that list settings open them as the settings pages do with
`ui::setting_opens` (its editor, the keyboard for text, the list of a
choice's values); text typed there comes back to the kernel as
`events::SETTING_TYPED`, which sets it.

### Events

```rust
r.on(events::BOOK_OPENED, move |env, reading, out| {
    opened.set(opened.get() + 1);
    // reading.path, reading.title, reading.progress, reading.at() …
})?;
```

The kernel and plugins emit events; any plugin can listen. An `Event<P>`
names an event and what it carries, a struct made with `event_data!`,
so emitting (`EVENT.emit(data)`) and hearing (`r.on`) are checked as
the plugin is built; screens get every event too and read one with
`EVENT.read(event, params)` in `Screen::on_event`. Standard ones are in
`builtin::events`: started, a setting changed, a book opened, a page
turned, a book moved, books came into the library or left it, its
bookmarks or highlights changed, a word looked up, a place in the open
book to show, text chosen, notes exported, the device suspends or
resumes, PaperPaw stops (a restart: save as at suspending, but it is no
sleep). Plugins define their own the same way (in their namespace),
and `EVENT.schedule(data, at)` emits one at a time (work at a time,
below). Underneath, what events carry travels as named
strings (`Params`): events known only at run time are heard by id with
`r.subscribe`.

Answers come as events too, typed in `replies`: a plugin names the
event it wants, e.g. `const FETCHED: Event<HttpReply> =
Event::new("news.fetched")`, and passes it with the request. To ask
the reader, `ask::text("Server", &ENTERED).initial(url).command()`
opens the keyboard and brings back a `Typed`, `ask::folder` a
`Chosen`, and `choice::open` a `Picked`. What the plugin added
(`.with(key, value)`) comes back as the answer's `context`, to tell
its questions apart.

What is known of books is a service, not a screen's: `library` has a
book's details (title, author, series, tags, cover, progress, and
fields plugins add with `library::set_field`), the books read last and
the favourites, so any plugin can show or use them. Views of many books
read the catalog rather than each book (below, "What every library
offers"), show covers made small and kept on the storage
(`library::cover_variant`, a few kilobytes each, not the picture, one
for each size a view shows) and take a book's details with the size a
listing told (`library::listing`, `library::book_sized`): on a card,
each file looked up again is a search through its folder.

The bookmarks and highlights of books are shared: `annotations` reads
and keeps them, and whoever changes them emits
`annotations::changed(book)`, so the reader shows them anew and syncs
pass them on (the `koreader` plugin, for example).

State a plugin keeps between events lives in an `Rc` it hands to its
handlers when it registers.

### Translations

```ini
[meta]
language = en
name = English
plural = one-other

[messages]
hello.title = Hello
# {name} is the name set, {count} the books opened since the start.
hello.greeting.one = Hello, {name}! You opened {count} book.
hello.greeting.other = Hello, {name}! You opened {count} books.
```

Every text a plugin shows comes from catalogs like this, added with
`r.add_translations(…)`; English first, then any other language. `tr`
translates, `format` fills `{placeholders}`, `plural` picks the form for
a number. A test that all languages have the same keys belongs in every
plugin (see the sample).

### Testing

Plugins are tested with the real kernel and an in-memory storage, as the
sample's [test](../samples/hello-plugin/tests/hello.rs) does: build a
kernel with the plugin, send it input, look at the open screen, the
settings, the files, the HTTP requests it makes (`Kernel::take_io`)
and answer them (`Kernel::http_response`). The emulator then shows how it
looks and how much memory it needs on each device:

```sh
cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator -- --profile xteink-x4 --headless --script "confirm" --screenshot out.png
```

Before a plugin is published, `paperpaw-dev` checks all of it on every
device: see [Checking your plugin](#checking-your-plugin).
