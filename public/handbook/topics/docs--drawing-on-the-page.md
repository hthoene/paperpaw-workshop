### Drawing on the page

A page layer (`layers::PageLayerSpec`) draws on every page a reader
shows: side notes, a reading ruler, change bars. It may reserve room at
a side of the text, which is then laid out without it, and it hears
taps on that room (`events::PAGE_LAYER_TAPPED`, also when the room is
chosen with the buttons, as links are):

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::layers::{PageLayerSpec, Side};

r.add_page_layer(
    PageLayerSpec::new(Id::new_static("notes.margin"), "notes.margin", |canvas, env, page| {
        let Some(room) = page.room else { return };
        for line in page.lines.iter().filter(|l| has_note(env, page.path, l.start)) {
            canvas.fill_rect(room.x.into(), line.area.y.into(), 4, line.area.height.into(), Color::BLACK);
        }
    })
    .reserve(|env| Some((Side::Right, env.metrics().mm(8) as u16)))
    .taps(),
)?;
```

- `page` (`PageView`) has the book, the page's start and end, the
  text's box and columns, its lines (`LineBox`: where each is and what
  it holds), the status lines and the layer's room.
- Layers draw what they know from memory, on some devices once for every
  band of the page: they read nothing from storage there. Those of an
  order below 0 are drawn behind the text.
- A layer whose drawing changes while the page stays asks for the
  screen to be drawn again (`Command::Redraw(RefreshMode::Fast)`).

A layer that writes between the lines, an interlinear reading with a
small translation above each line, takes two parts: a text filter asks
for room above every line (`Block::leading_above`, in hundredths of an
em), which the layout adds to each line's height, so pages break with
it and words are hit where they are drawn; and a layer that asks for the
page's words (`.words()`) finds them in `page.words` (`WordBox`: each
word's box, text and place), measured once a page and only where a
layer asks:

```rust
const ON: Setting<bool> = Setting::new("interlinear.on");

r.add_text_filter(TextFilterSpec::new(
    Id::new_static("interlinear.room"),
    "interlinear.room",
    // Seven tenths of an em above every line, while switched on.
    Box::new(|env, block| {
        if env.settings().read(&ON) {
            block.leading_above = Some(70);
        }
    }),
    // Changes with the setting: pages are laid out anew.
    Box::new(|env| u64::from(env.settings().read(&ON))),
))?;
r.add_page_layer(
    PageLayerSpec::new(Id::new_static("interlinear.words"), "interlinear.words", |canvas, env, page| {
        for word in page.words {
            // The room above the word's line: line.leading pixels high.
            let Some(line) = page.lines.iter().find(|l| l.start <= word.start && word.start < l.end) else { continue };
            let gloss = translation(env, page.language, word.lookup_text());
            draw_small(canvas, env, word.area.x, line.area.y - line.leading, gloss);
        }
    })
    .switch(&ON)
    .words(),
)?;
```

A filter may also insert blocks after the one it gets: a translation
after each paragraph (a parallel text), a gloss, a note. They show after
the block and never apart from its last line, and take no place in the
book: positions, progress, bookmarks, highlights and search stay the
book's. At most four, 4 KiB of text, and best shorter than a page (they
cannot go on over a page break):

```rust
let translation = translate(&block.text);
let len = translation.len() as u32;
block.insert_after(Block::new(BlockKind::Paragraph, 0, len, translation));
```

A layer takes taps on what it draws by saying where its items are; a tap
on one, or Select on one chosen with the buttons as links are, comes to
its plugin as `events::PAGE_LAYER_TAPPED` with the item's id
(`tapped.item`), and every other tap and button stays the reader's:

```rust
PageLayerSpec::new(id, "interlinear.words", draw)
    .items(|_, page| {
        page.lines.iter().enumerate()
            .filter(|(_, l)| l.leading > 0)
            .map(|(i, l)| LayerItem::new(i as u32, Rect::new(l.area.x, l.area.y - l.leading, l.area.width, l.leading)).label("Translation"))
            .collect()
    })
```

`samples/interlinear` is all of this as a plugin to start from.

A frame (`layers::PageFrameSpec`) sets the text in columns: two
columns, two pages side by side. The setting `core.page-frame` (each
book may have its own) offers every frame by its id, named by the
translation of the id:

```rust
r.add_page_frame(PageFrameSpec::columns(Id::new_static("columns.two"), 2, 24))?;
```
