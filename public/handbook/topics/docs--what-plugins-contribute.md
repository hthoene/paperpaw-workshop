## What plugins contribute

| Contribution | Registrar | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Actions | `add_action` | Something to do, bound to buttons and gestures, listed in menus |
| Screens | `add_screen` | Full screens and overlays (menus, dialogs, panels) |
| Slots | `add_slot`, `bind_slot` | Roles a screen fills: home, reader, library, menu, settings, keyboard, dictionary, … |
| Menu entries and sections | `add_menu_entry`, `add_menu_section`, `place_menu_entry`, `hide_menu_entry` | Actions, settings and submenus in any menu, by order or beside other entries (`MenuPlace`: after, before, in a section, first, last); another plugin's entry taken out. A menu the user redefined shows entries added later too |
| What entries show now | `set_item_state`, `describe_item` | A label, a switch, faint, hidden or a badge of the plugin's own entries as things are now (`ItemState`); a line under an entry |
| Icons | `add_icon` | The icon of an action, setting group or menu; of a semantic icon (`icons::BACK`, `NEXT`, `SHIFT`, …) for a theme; `U+F8000` names a code point of one's own |
| Settings and groups | `add_setting`, `add_setting_group` | Shown and saved by the kernel. A group names its order in the sections of the main page (`SettingGroupSpec::order`: books 1 to 49, the device 51 to 199, customising from 201) and an icon (`add_icon` with its id); one that names no order is listed at the end of customising, by name, with a plugin's icon |
| Setting defaults | `set_setting_default` | New defaults for other plugins' settings (themes) |
| Event handlers | `on`, `subscribe` | React to events |
| Key maps | `add_keymap`, `add_keymap_preset`, `add_keymap_when` | What buttons, taps and swipes do; bindings that apply while a switch is on |
| Formats | `add_format` | Open a kind of file as a document to read; big pictures may be decoded when their page shows (`Document::prepare_image`); files without a known extension told by their first bytes (`FormatSpec::sniff`); the format's own settings in `OpenOptions::setting`; a document still coming says `DocumentError::NotReady`, then `events::DOCUMENT_READY` |
| Lookup providers | `add_lookup_provider` | Where words are looked up (a glossary, a translator, Wikipedia): the dictionary's panel lists every provider's entries, those that go online when asked; an entry may open a screen with more of it (`LookupEntry::more`) |
| Reading apps | `add_reader` | A screen of the plugin that reads books of some formats (a comics reader), offered where books open and chosen per format, folder or book |
| Voices | `add_voice` | Speak text aloud in place of the system's voice, for the languages it speaks, chosen with `settings::VOICE` |
| Fonts | `add_font`, `add_font_file`, `bind_font` | Fonts and the roles they fill |
| Hyphenation | `add_hyphenation` | Patterns for a language |
| Text filters | `add_text_filter` | Change a book's text before it is laid out |
| Decorators | `add_decorator` | Mark words on book pages (a background, a line, a frame), drawn the same by every reader |
| Page layers and frames | `add_page_layer`, `add_page_frame` | Draw on book pages beside the words, with room of one's own; set pages in columns |
| Input filters | `add_input_filter` | See every button and finger first: pass it, take it, or run an action instead |
| Refresh filters | `add_refresh_filter` | Change how the panel is refreshed, e.g. in full on a screen of your own |
| Status items, lines and places | `add_status_item`, `add_status_line`, `add_status_place` | What status lines show, what a tap on an item does, how much it matters where a line is full; places where items show (`status::Place`) |
| A look | `set_ui_look` | Another look for switches, the focus, separators, buttons, headers, button hints, progress bars, sliders and widgets' frames on every screen (`ui::look`) |
| Widgets and their places | `add_widget`, `add_widget_place`, `add_widget_category` | Blocks for the home screen and the sleep screen; places that show widgets (`widgets::WidgetPlace`), in a grid or above each other (`widgets::WidgetStack`), which plugins ask whether they show theirs (`Widgets::shown`); kinds of widgets of one's own, with their icon |
| Setup steps | `add_setup_step` | A page of the first-run setup: a setting to choose or a screen of the plugin's, where the device needs it |
| Services | `provide` | Anything one plugin offers others, found with `env.services().get` |
| Contributions | `contribute` | Additions to a point another plugin defined |
| Translations | `add_translations` | Catalogs for any language |
| Book data | `add_book_data`, `add_book_cache` | Where the plugin keeps something for each book (named by `library::key`): moved and removed with the book. What `add_book_cache` names (made again from the book when needed) is cleaned up by itself when the book is gone; what `add_book_data` names (the reader's own: notes, places) only when the reader agrees, in *Clean up storage* |
| Book fields | `add_book_field` | A value kept with books (`library::set_field`), shown on their information page and, where `in_catalog`, kept in the catalog to filter by |
| Book badges | `add_book_badge` | A few letters or an icon on books' rows in views of the library |
| Actions of others | `override_action` | Runs in place of any action's own handler; of several, the highest priority wins |
| Inputs and gestures of one's own | `add_input`, `add_gesture` | `input.<id>` and `gesture.<id>`, bound in key maps like any other |
| Bars across screens | `add_chrome` | Tabs, a dock or a bar along an edge that stays while screens open and close (`chrome`) |
| Watching | `observe_actions`, `observe_events` | Sees every action before it runs, and every event after its handlers |
| Menus by device | `set_menu_need` | Offers an entry only where the device can do it, e.g. speak |
| Points and events declared | `add_point`, `declare_event` | Says what a point takes and what an event carries, for authors and for rules |

Slots are how a plugin replaces another: bind your screen to
`core.home` and it is the home screen; the user's
`[slots]` configuration has the final word. Where several plugins offer
a screen for a slot, *Settings, Plugins, Screens* lets the reader choose
one (or *Automatic*, the plugins' order), and a plugin newly installed
that offers one asks once whether to use it now. `Env::slot_choice`,
`slot_title` and `screen_title` tell a screen of one's own the same.
Built-in slots are in
`builtin::slots`, built-in menus in `builtin::menus`: the main menu
(`core.main`), its tools (`core.tools`) and the settings' pages
(`core.settings-pages`).

```rust
// A home screen of one's own: preferred over the shipped one.
r.add_screen(ScreenSpec::new(SHELF, "shelf.title", Box::new(|env, _| Box::new(Shelf::new(env)))))?;
r.bind_slot(slots::HOME, SHELF, Priority::PREFERRED)?;
```

### What a slot's screen does

A screen bound to a standard slot takes the parameters the others open
it with and answers as they expect, so that every plugin works with it:

| Slot | Opened with | The screen |
|---|---|---|
| `core.home` | nothing; at the start and by `actions::HOME` | is the bottom of the stack: opened again, the screens above it close. It leads to the menu and the library by touch and by buttons alone. |
| `core.library` | nothing; by `actions::LIBRARY` | opens a book with `readers::open` (the reading app chosen for it). For a book it offers the menu `menus::BOOK`, as `Menus::shown_items` has it: when an entry is chosen it emits `events::BOOK_CHOSEN` with the book, then runs the entry's action. |
| `core.settings` | nothing: the groups; `params::ID`: the settings of that group; `params::FOCUS`: the page of that setting, focused on it | changes settings with `Command::SetSetting`, and a setting with an editor (`SettingExtra::editor`, a screen or a slot) by opening that (`Editor::open`). |
| `core.menu` | `params::MENU`, the menu; `params::HIDE`, entries to leave out this time | shows `env.menus().items(menu)`; for an entry chosen it closes (`Command::Back`) and runs its action (`Command::RunAction`); a setting listed there it changes, or opens its editor. |
| `core.choose-folder`, `core.choose-value` | `params::ID`, the setting | writes the folder, or the value, chosen to the setting. Name the slot as the editor (`SettingExtra::editor_slot`) to have it edited there by whichever plugin fills it. |
| `core.choice` | `params::TITLE`, `PATH` (what it is about), the options, `REPLY`; asked with `ask::choice` | shows the options; for one chosen it closes and emits the reply as a `Picked` with the option and `path`; *Back* or a tap outside closes without one. |
| `core.confirm` | `params::TITLE` (the question), `TEXT`, `ui::confirm::YES_LABEL`, `NO_LABEL`, `FOCUS_YES`, `REPLY`; asked with `ask::confirm` | asks yes or no, the focus on no unless `FOCUS_YES`; for an answer it closes and emits the reply as a `Confirmed` with all of its parameters; *Back* or a tap outside closes without one. |
| `core.keyboard` | `params::TITLE`, `TEXT` (to start from), `MODE` (`text`, `number`, `password`), `REPLY`, `LIVE` | on confirming, closes and emits the event named by `reply` as a `Typed` with all of its parameters; with `live`, on each change too, with `Typed::typing` set; *Back* closes without an answer. `ask::text` asks this way. |

The documentation of `builtin::slots` says the same for every slot.

### Which one wins

- **Slots.** The screen the user chose in `[slots]` (*Screens*,
  above); else the binding
  with the highest `Priority` (`FALLBACK`, `DEFAULT`, `PREFERRED`, or
  any number); between equal priorities, the one registered later,
  that is of the plugin loaded later.
- **Key bindings.** A later source overrides an earlier one for the
  same button or gesture: the plugins' `add_keymap`, in the order the
  plugins load; then their `add_keymap_when` while its switch is on, so
  these override the plugins' plain bindings; then the device's, the
  preset the user chose, and the user's own `[keymap.*]`. A plugin's
  binding never overrides the device's, the preset's or the user's.
- **Menus.** Entries in their `order`, equal orders in the order they
  were added; a menu the user redefined in their order, with entries
  contributed since after their neighbour.

### Examples

A format: files with these extensions open as a `Document`.

```rust
r.add_format(FormatSpec::new(
    Id::new_static("notes.format"),
    "notes.format",
    vec![Cow::Borrowed("note")],
    Box::new(|storage, path, _options| Notes::open(storage, path)),
))?;
```

A status item: what a status line shows, `None` to hide it. A tap on
it runs an action of its own plugin, here one that opens the notes.
Where a line is full, items of a low priority give way first.

```rust
r.add_status_item(
    StatusItemSpec::new(
        Id::new_static("notes.count"),
        "notes.count",
        Box::new(|env, _| Some(StatusValue::Text(count(env).to_string()))),
    )
    .tap(Id::new_static("notes.open"))
    .priority(96),
)?;
```

An input filter: it sees every button and finger first.

```rust
r.add_input_filter(InputFilterSpec::new(
    Id::new_static("lock.filter"),
    "lock.filter",
    Box::new(|env, _input| if locked(env) { InputVerdict::Take } else { InputVerdict::Pass }),
))?;
```

A request and its answer: the reply event brings the `HttpReply`.

```rust
const FETCHED: Event<HttpReply> = Event::new("news.fetched");
// In an action or a screen:
out.push(Command::http(HttpRequest::get("https://example.org/feed", &FETCHED)));
// When registering:
r.on(FETCHED, |_env, reply, out| {
    if reply.status == 200 {
        out.push(Command::Notify(headline(&reply.body)));
    }
})?;
```

A timer: the work's event comes at that time, here each hour.

```rust
const TICK: Event<()> = Event::new("weather.tick");
out.push(Command::work(
    Work::at(&TICK, env.now().add_millis(60 * 60 * 1000)).every(Duration::from_secs(3600)),
));
r.on(TICK, |_env, _, out| out.push(Command::http(HttpRequest::get(FORECAST, &FETCHED))))?;
```

### What every reader offers

A plugin that works with books never names the reader plugin: it uses
what `builtin` defines for every reader, so a reader of one's own (bound
to `core.reader`) replaces the shipped one in full. A reader of some
formats only registers as a reading app instead (`readers::ReaderSpec`,
`Registrar::add_reader`): books open in the app chosen for them, and
whatever opens a book opens it with `readers::open(path)` (never by
opening `slots::READER` itself). The reader chooses with
`readers::ask_once` (*Open with …* in the book menu: this time, or kept
when asked; plugins add other ways to open a book to `menus::OPEN_WITH`),
`readers::ask` (a book's or a folder's reading app, kept) and in the reading
settings (`settings::READING_APP`, and one per format that more than one
app reads). A reading app's screen is its own; one that cannot open a
book after all answers `readers::cannot_open` instead of an error of
its own, and the next app in that order opens it. One reading app is
open at a time. What moves folders calls `readers::folder_moved`, so
that their choices go along; a shell opens a book with
`Kernel::open_book`.

| What | Standard | |
|---|---|---|
| Show a place in the open book, a part marked | `events::GOTO` (`Goto`) | readers take it; tables of contents, bookmarks, search and syncs send it |
| Text chosen, and the action chosen for it | `menus::SELECTION`, `events::TEXT_CHOSEN` | add an action to the menu, hear the event |
| Notes exported as Markdown | `events::NOTES_EXPORTED` | for notes apps and syncs |
| The reader's menus | `menus::READER`, `READER_MORE`, `READER_PANEL` | add entries there |
| The type of pages | `settings::FONT_SIZE`, `FONT_WEIGHT`, `TEXT_CONTRAST`, `SMOOTH_TEXT`, `WORD_SPACING`, `LETTER_SPACING`, `KERNING`, `LIGATURES`, `LINE_SPACING`, `LINE_BREAKING`, `MARGIN`, `MARGIN_ENDS`, `JUSTIFY`, `HYPHENATE`, `HYPHEN_MIN_LEFT`, `HYPHEN_MIN_RIGHT`, `INDENT`, `INDENT_SIZE`, `PARAGRAPH_SPACING`, `PARAGRAPH_SPACE`, `WIDOWS`, `ORPHANS`, `PUBLISHER_STYLES`, `BOOK_ALIGN` and the other `BOOK_*`, `FOOTNOTES` | the kernel's settings (each book may have its own), which readers read |
| The page's words | `events::PAGE_WORDS_WANTED`, `reading::PageWords` | readers answer `reading::ask_page_words` |
| Where a book was left | `positions::{load, save}`, `Reading::xpointer` with `BOOK_CLOSED` | readers keep it; syncs and lists read it without opening the book |
| The contents, search, the marks, a footnote, skimming | `slots::TOC`, `SEARCH`, `ANNOTATIONS`, `FOOTNOTE`, `SKIM`, `events::FOLLOW_LINK`, `SKIM`, `SKIMMED` | bind a screen of one's own; readers open the slots, follow the links and go where skimming asks |
| A book opened as the reader opens it | `reading::open_options`, `reading::conversion` | its places fit the reader's (a search, contents, an XPointer) |
| Pages that go right to left | `Metadata::direction` (`PageProgression`), `Screen::mirrored` | readers mirror taps and swipes (an EPUB's `page-progression-direction`) |
| Status lines' settings | `groups::STATUS_LINES` | the group readers put them in |
| Reading aloud's settings | `group_sections::ALOUD` | the section readers and shells put them in |
| Key bindings while reading | the layer `[keymap.core.reader]` | the slot's layer, whichever screen fills it |

A reader in turn sends the reading events (`BOOK_OPENED`, `PAGE_TURNED`,
`BOOK_CLOSED`, `BOOK_FINISHED`), takes `GOTO`, and offers its actions
in these menus.

### What the other slots promise

A screen bound to one of these slots replaces the shipped one; it is
opened with what the table says and keeps its promises, so the plugins
around it go on working.

| Slot | Opened with | Promises |
|---|---|---|
| `slots::HOME` | nothing | The start screen; where it lists things to open, it lists `menus::APPS` and `menus::TOOLS` |
| `slots::MENU` | `params::MENU`, `params::HIDE` (entries left out this time) | The menu's entries as `Menus::shown_items` has them, with their state and the line under them; runs an action, changes a setting in place, opens a submenu |
| `slots::PANEL` | `params::MENU` | The same as controls for quick changes (sliders, switches) |
| `slots::SETTINGS` | `params::ID` (a group), or nothing for all | The settings by group and `menus::SETTINGS`; a choice with fewer than two values is not listed |
| `slots::KEYBOARD` | `params::TITLE`, `TEXT`, `MODE` (`text`, `number`, `password`), `REPLY` | Emits the event `reply` with every parameter it was opened with and `text` set to what was typed; nothing when cancelled |
| `slots::LOOKUP` | `params::WORD`, `LANGUAGE` | The entries of every lookup provider that knows the language (`lookup`), those that go online only when asked; an entry's `more` opened on request, by touch and with the buttons |

Points of the shipped plugins, for `Registrar::contribute`:

| Point | A line each | |
|---|---|---|
| `keyboard.layouts` | `id; code; letter rows; variants`, e.g. `dutch.layout; NL; qwertyuiop asdfghjkl zxcvbnm; e=éèë` | a layout to choose, named by the translation of its id |
| `about.lines` | a paragraph (Markdown) | shown on *About PaperPaw*, below the address |

A reader of one's own builds on the shipped one's parts in
`paperpaw_sdk::reading` rather than copying them: `FilteredDocument` (a
book through the plugins' text filters; kept `DroppedRuns` read the
blocks they leave out once), `PageIndex` (the starts of its
pages, kept on the device), and with the feature `unstable` (as the
layout, until 1.0) `PageType` (the page's box and type from the standard
settings, its layout key), `ReadingFaces` (the faces with the book's own
fonts and small capitals), `word_boxes`, `draw_lines` and `draw_image`;
`reading::note_text` is the text a footnote shows. The layout keeps at
least `Style::widows` lines of a paragraph at the top of a page and
`orphans` at the bottom (`Style::lines_kept`, from the settings
`WIDOWS` and `ORPHANS`; a paragraph that goes on whole takes its
heading along), and
`layout::wrap_lines_kerned` breaks lines of one's own as pages do, with
the pairs `Typesetter::kern` gives (`ReadingFaces` kerns as it draws;
`FontHandle::kern`, `unkerned` and `ligatures` for text of one's own).
For a custom balanced layout,
`paperpaw_text::wrap_lines_balanced_kerned_with_cost` takes an
additional cost callback `(unused_width, spaces) -> f32` for non-final
candidate lines. For example, `|free, spaces| free * free / (spaces.max(1)
as f32)` adds a penalty for concentrating spare width in few gaps. The
ordinary raggedness and hyphen costs still apply; the existing balanced
functions keep their behavior. Readers using `PageType` and
`layout_page` already get bounded justification and matching break
selection. Their page indexes must use the current layout key;
`layout::VERSION` is a cache revision, separate from the native plugin
interface.
`PageType::patterns` gives the patterns of the page's language with the
letters the reader keeps before and after a hyphen (`HYPHEN_MIN_LEFT`,
`HYPHEN_MIN_RIGHT`; 0: the table's own, see
`hyphen::Patterns::with_minimums`); a reader of one's own hyphenates
with them.

A text filter that needs to know where a block is, or leaves blocks out
(a web page's adverts, printed page numbers in a book), is a block
filter: `TextFilterSpec::block` gets a `FilterContext` (the book, its
language, the place) and answers `Verdict::Keep` or `Verdict::Drop`.

### What every library offers

A view of the library of one's own (bound to `core.library`) is as
fast as the shipped one, on the X4 too, as both ask the same service
and read the same catalog; plugins that add to the library add to
every view of it.

| What | Standard | |
|---|---|---|
| The library to ask | `library::service(env)`, a `trait Library` | A book's details, the catalog's state, queries, the index of all books, finished and favourite. Deleting books: `delete`, `can_delete`. A library of one's own provides a `LibraryService` as `library::service::SERVICE` in `library::service::VERSION`, with at least `each`, `records` and `version`. |
| Every book, without reading each | `library::catalog` | One line a book: author, title, series, number, tags, how far read, favourite, opened, added, fields. Read in pieces with `each`, `each_at` and `read_at`. |
| Books found, a page at a time | `catalog::Query`, `query`, `found` | by how far read, words, author, series, tag, folder, added since; sorted by title, author, series or added |
| All books to sort and filter in memory | `library::index::Index` | 24 bytes a book, at most 2000 on the X4 (48 KB). Kept in a file while a book is open with `save` and `load`. Status changes are taken with `refresh`. |
| The catalog made anew | the kernel, as work in the background, never while a book is open | Walked once a view asks after a start (`library::request_catalog`, `request_catalog_anew`). Also for a new library folder and after `LIBRARY_CHANGED`. Caught up after `BOOK_ADDED`, `BOOK_MOVED` and changed fields. `BOOK_REMOVED` leaves a book out at once. Then `events::CATALOG_CHANGED` comes. |
| Something of one book changed | `events::BOOK_CHANGED` (`library::changed_book`, bits of `library::what`) | finished, a favourite, read further, details, cover, a field |
| A book came | `events::BOOK_ADDED` (`library::added(path, source)`) | transfers, syncs and downloads send it |
| A book deleted | `Library::delete`, which answers `library::Deleted` | Only books are deleted: a format known by its extension or first bytes, outside PaperPaw's own folder (`library::is_book_path`). Others are refused, and what fails says why. Asking first is the view's job, as the book's sheet does. The kernel's library removes the files and sends `events::BOOK_REMOVED` for each. The kernel then forgets the book and removes what is kept for it in the folders of `Registrar::add_book_data`. Views leave it out at once. |
| What can be done with a book | `menus::BOOK`, `events::BOOK_CHOSEN` | add an action to the menu, hear which book it was chosen for |
| Another way to open a book | `menus::OPEN_WITH`, `events::BOOK_CHOSEN` | add an action to the list of *Open with …*, beside the reading apps; it hears the book as the book menu's actions do |
| A book's information | `slots::BOOK_INFO` | lists the fields of `add_book_field` |
| Where the books are | `settings::LIBRARY_FOLDER` (`library::folder(env)`) | the kernel's setting, chosen with `screens::FOLDER_EDITOR` (the folder chooser of `slots::CHOOSE_FOLDER`) |

How far a book is read and whether it is a favourite change while the
catalog stands: the kernel notes such changes beside it (when a book is
opened, closed or finished, and through the service's setters), so a
view knows them at once without a new catalog and without reading each
book. A view keeps nothing of the catalog but its index, of the
library's version (`Library::version`: keys hold only for it,
`Library::is_current`); a page's books are read by their keys in one go
(`Library::records`), their badges asked then
(`library::service::badges`), never while drawing.


### Services and points of your own

A plugin can offer others more than the kernel knows of. A service is
a value provided under an id in its namespace, in a version, usually a
struct holding a trait object whose trait the plugin's crate exports.
Its type names its contract in a key, such as `"weather.forecast/1"`,
written with `service_type!`; the key changes (`/2`) when the type's
fields do. Others use the service when it is there and do without it
when not:

```rust
// In the providing plugin's crate.
pub struct Weather(pub Box<dyn Forecast>);
paperpaw_sdk::service_type!(Weather, "weather.forecast/1");

// The providing plugin's `register`.
r.provide(WEATHER, Weather(Box::new(Today::new())), Version::new(1, 0, 0))?;

// Any other plugin, wherever it has an `Env`: version 1.0 or later.
if let Some(weather) = env.services().get::<Weather>(WEATHER.as_str(), Version::new(1, 0, 0)) {
    let today = weather.0.today();
}
```

A service is found by its key, so native code plugins built apart from
the firmware find it too (see *Plugins as files* below); its size and
alignment are checked.

A point is an id a plugin names, with what a contribution there is in
its documentation (for example one line per entry); others add to it
with `r.contribute(point, text)`, and the plugin reads
`env.services().contributions(point)`, each with the plugin it came from.

### Marks (decorations)

A plugin marks words on book pages with a decorator (ADR 0021): it gets
the words of a page with their places in the book and gives back ranges,
each with a *role*. The reader draws them; the plugin knows neither the
reader nor the panel.

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::decorations::{self, Decorated, Decoration, DecoratorSpec, LineKind};

const LEARNING: Id = Id::new_static("vocabulary.learning");

// The role: its look is settings (Settings, Marks), the
// plugin gives the default; themes and users change it.
decorations::add_role(r, &LEARNING, "vocabulary.role.learning",
    Decoration::NONE.line(LineKind::Dotted))?;
r.add_decorator(
    DecoratorSpec::new(Id::new_static("vocabulary.words"), "vocabulary.decorator",
        |env, page| {
            page.words
                .iter()
                .filter(|w| is_learnt(env, w.text))
                .filter_map(|w| Decorated::words(core::slice::from_ref(w), &LEARNING))
                .collect()
        })
    .switch(&MARK)          // a bool setting turns it on and off
    .taps()                 // taps on its marks come back
    .signature(|env| words_changed(env)),
)?;
r.on(events::DECORATION_TAPPED, |env, tapped, out| { /* tapped.text */ })?;
```

- A `Decoration` is a background, the text's ink, a line under the text
  (solid, dotted, dashed, wavy, double) with its tone and thickness, a
  frame, struck through; tones are named, and each panel shows them as
  well as it can (colours, or their lightness, dithered where there are
  few grays).
- Each aspect of a role is a setting of its own (`<role>.background`,
  `.ink`, `.line`, `.line-tone`, `.thickness`, `.frame`, `.struck`), so
  profiles, rules and themes set them like any other.
- Decorators are asked once a page is laid out, and again when their
  signature changes (their data, their settings): keep it cheap, and
  never work on a whole book.
- Where marks meet on a word, the earlier decorator (by `order`) wins an
  aspect both set; the rest combine.
- The reader's own marks are roles too: `roles::HIGHLIGHT`, `LINK`,
  `SEARCH_HIT`, `ALOUD`. A reader of one's own draws all marks with
  `decorations::draw_behind` and `draw_over`.
- What changes widths (bold, a larger size) is a text filter instead: it
  lays the page out again.

Words found by patterns need no code of one's own:
`decorations::PatternDecorator` marks what its patterns
(`paperpaw_sdk::pattern`, a small part of regular expressions: classes,
`\b`, repeats, `|`, groups, `(?i)`, with bounded work) find on the page's
text, each in its role:

```rust
let names = PatternDecorator::new()
    .rule(Pattern::new(r"\b(?:Mr|Mrs|Miss)\. [A-Z]\w+").unwrap(), NAME)
    .into_spec(Id::new_static("tale.names"), "tale.names");
r.add_decorator(names)?;
```

A plugin without code does the same with a `marks.ini`, a section per
role (`<plugin>.<section>`), its patterns and its look:

```ini
[names]
title = Names
pattern = \b(?:Mr|Mrs|Miss)\. [A-Z]\w+
background = yellow
line = wavy
```

Any plugin can read the words of the page shown, not only decorators:
`reading::ask_page_words(&MY_WORDS)` asks the reader, which answers with
the event `MY_WORDS`, a `reading::PageWords` (the book, the page's start
and end, its words with their places).

### Drawing on the page

A page layer (`layers::PageLayerSpec`) draws on every page a reader
shows: side notes, a reading ruler, change bars. It may reserve room at
a side of the text, which is then laid out without it, and it hears
taps on that room (`events::PAGE_LAYER_TAPPED`, also when the room is
chosen with the buttons, as links are):

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::layers::{PageLayerSpec, Side};

r.add_page_layer(
    PageLayerSpec::new(Id::new_static("notes.margin"), "notes.margin", |canvas, env, page| {
        let Some(room) = page.room else { return };
        for line in page.lines.iter().filter(|l| has_note(env, page.path, l.start)) {
            canvas.fill_rect(room.x.into(), line.area.y.into(), 4, line.area.height.into(), Color::BLACK);
        }
    })
    .reserve(|env| Some((Side::Right, env.metrics().mm(8) as u16)))
    .taps(),
)?;
```

- `page` (`PageView`) has the book, the page's start and end, the
  text's box and columns, its lines (`LineBox`: where each is and what
  it holds), the status lines and the layer's room.
- Layers draw what they know from memory, on some devices once for every
  band of the page: they read nothing from storage there. Those of an
  order below 0 are drawn behind the text.
- A layer whose drawing changes while the page stays asks for the
  screen to be drawn again (`Command::Redraw(RefreshMode::Fast)`).

A layer that writes between the lines, an interlinear reading with a
small translation above each line, takes two parts: a text filter asks
for room above every line (`Block::leading_above`, in hundredths of an
em), which the layout adds to each line's height, so pages break with
it and words are hit where they are drawn; and a layer that asks for the
page's words (`.words()`) finds them in `page.words` (`WordBox`: each
word's box, text and place), measured once a page and only where a
layer asks:

```rust
const ON: Setting<bool> = Setting::new("interlinear.on");

r.add_text_filter(TextFilterSpec::new(
    Id::new_static("interlinear.room"),
    "interlinear.room",
    // Seven tenths of an em above every line, while switched on.
    Box::new(|env, block| {
        if env.settings().read(&ON) {
            block.leading_above = Some(70);
        }
    }),
    // Changes with the setting: pages are laid out anew.
    Box::new(|env| u64::from(env.settings().read(&ON))),
))?;
r.add_page_layer(
    PageLayerSpec::new(Id::new_static("interlinear.words"), "interlinear.words", |canvas, env, page| {
        for word in page.words {
            // The room above the word's line: line.leading pixels high.
            let Some(line) = page.lines.iter().find(|l| l.start <= word.start && word.start < l.end) else { continue };
            let gloss = translation(env, page.language, word.lookup_text());
            draw_small(canvas, env, word.area.x, line.area.y - line.leading, gloss);
        }
    })
    .switch(&ON)
    .words(),
)?;
```

A filter may also insert blocks after the one it gets: a translation
after each paragraph (a parallel text), a gloss, a note. They show after
the block and never apart from its last line, and take no place in the
book: positions, progress, bookmarks, highlights and search stay the
book's. At most four, 4 KiB of text, and best shorter than a page (they
cannot go on over a page break):

```rust
let translation = translate(&block.text);
let len = translation.len() as u32;
block.insert_after(Block::new(BlockKind::Paragraph, 0, len, translation));
```

A layer takes taps on what it draws by saying where its items are; a tap
on one, or Select on one chosen with the buttons as links are, comes to
its plugin as `events::PAGE_LAYER_TAPPED` with the item's id
(`tapped.item`), and every other tap and button stays the reader's:

```rust
PageLayerSpec::new(id, "interlinear.words", draw)
    .items(|_, page| {
        page.lines.iter().enumerate()
            .filter(|(_, l)| l.leading > 0)
            .map(|(i, l)| LayerItem::new(i as u32, Rect::new(l.area.x, l.area.y - l.leading, l.area.width, l.leading)).label("Translation"))
            .collect()
    })
```

`samples/interlinear` is all of this as a plugin to start from.

A frame (`layers::PageFrameSpec`) sets the text in columns: two
columns, two pages side by side. The setting `core.page-frame` (each
book may have its own) offers every frame by its id, named by the
translation of the id:

```rust
r.add_page_frame(PageFrameSpec::columns(Id::new_static("columns.two"), 2, 24))?;
```

### Pictures over what is drawn

Any screen, widget, theme or overlay draws a picture over what is drawn
already: a PNG or GIF keeps its transparency (an alpha channel, a
palette's or a colour key) when decoded with
`image::picture_with_alpha` (others come out opaque; why not, where it
cannot be read), and `ui::draw_image_over` blends it in, its clear
parts showing what is below, its edges mixed with it, and all of it as
see-through as its `opacity` (0 to 255) says. The mix is dithered as
pictures are, so it keeps its lightness on panels of two or four grays;
rows are read and blended one at a time, so a picture takes no memory
of its size. Pictures made larger than they are decoded are
interpolated, not blocky.

```rust
match image::picture_with_alpha(env.storage(), "plugins/owls/owl.png", &cache, Fit::side(200)) {
    Ok(image) => ui::draw_image_over(canvas, env.storage(), &image, area, 192), // a quarter see-through
    Err(why) => { /* e.g. "unsupported image: interlaced PNG" */ }
}
```

An overlay that draws only part of its region, or blends over it, says
what shows through it (`Screen::shows_through`): every screen below it,
menus too (`ShowsThrough::All`), or the topmost full screen alone, a
menu left open over it not drawn (`ShowsThrough::FullScreen`); what
shows is drawn first under all of it. A screen guarding the device is
marked in `env.stack()` (`StackEntry::guards`), so that nothing shows what
is below it. The sleep screen's *The page with a picture* shows the
full screen through: a picture or a widget over the page being read;
pictures for it are offered as presets (below).

A setting's choices are open to other plugins: `Registrar::add_choice`
offers a value of one's own among them (in one's namespace, the
translation key of its name), after the setting's own. This is how the
sleep screen shows a screen of another plugin as one of its modes. The
flash card due and the reading cat are such modes:

```rust
r.add_screen(ScreenSpec::new(Id::new_static("aquarium.sleep"), "aquarium.sleep", factory))?;
r.add_choice(Id::new_static("sleep.show"), "aquarium.sleep")?;
```

### Widgets

A widget is a [`Widget`] a screen makes and keeps
(`env.widgets().make`): it reads what it shows in `update`, which the
screen calls when it shows the widget, about each minute and after
events, and only draws in `draw` (which runs for every band of a
frame). The screen tells it where it goes (`place`) before drawing it
there: what is made for that size, such as a cover made small
(`ui::Thumbnail`), is made then, and again in `update` when what it
shows changed. Register it with `WidgetSpec::new(id, title, factory)`; a widget
with nothing to read, such as a clock, is a pair of functions
(`WidgetSpec::drawn` with `Drawn::new(height, draw)`, and `shows` to be
drawn again when what it shows changes). A widget whose content changes
only after events (books, settings) says so (`live` false) and is not
read again each minute; one that can be drawn smaller says how small
(`min_height`), so that a grid fits it where its full height has no
room. `widgets::grid` puts widgets
and tools in a grid as the home screen does, edited in place
(`GridView`). Say which kind a widget is
(`.category(widgets::categories::TIME)`, or `BOOKS`, `READING`, `WORDS`,
`PERSONAL`, `WORLD`, `DEVICE`): the home screen offers widgets by their
kind, each drawn as it would show.

A widget may also react. `targets` names the places in it that do
something. `on_input` gets taps, swipes and the buttons there, and
`context` tells it its placement and the screen it is on. `draw_focus`
draws the focus its own way.

### Widgets with settings

A widget may have settings of its own, such as where its text sits. Put
them in a settings group with the widget's id
(`widgets::settings_group`); the settings list leaves such groups out,
and the home screen's editor offers them as the widget's *Settings*. For
the alignment there is a ready setting: register
`widgets::align_setting(&id, Align::Left)` and place each text with
`widgets::align(env, id).x(area, width)`.

Widgets of all plugins share a look the reader shapes for each, so that
they sit well together on a page: give yours a frame and draw in it.

```rust
const ID: Id = Id::new_static("my.card");
static SETTINGS: [SettingSpec; 4] = [
    widgets::align_spec("my.card.align", ID, Align::Left),
    widgets::frame_spec("my.card.frame", ID, Frame::None), // none, line, light or dark card
    widgets::size_spec("my.card.size", ID, TextSize::Medium, true), // true: also "as large as it fits"
    widgets::part_spec("my.card.author", ID, "my.show-author", true),
];
r.add_setting_group(widgets::settings_group(&ID, "my.card"))?;
r.add_settings(&SETTINGS)?;

fn draw(&self, canvas: &mut Canvas<'_>, env: &Env<'_>, area: Rect) {
    let look = widgets::draw_frame(canvas, env, ID.as_str(), area);
    let rest = widgets::draw_caption(canvas, env, ID.as_str(), &look, "Today");
    let size = widgets::size(env, ID.as_str()).text(&UiStyle::new(env));
    // ... the content in `rest`, in `look.ink` (and `look.faint` for
    // what matters less), never in a fixed black: on a dark card it is
    // light.
}
```

A widget may be placed more than once, each placement with its own
values of the widget's settings: the home screen places a clock as
`widgets.clock@1` and `widgets.clock@2`, whose frames are the settings
`widgets.clock@1.frame` and `widgets.clock@2.frame` (saved like any
other, the widget's own `widgets.clock.frame` where one sets none).
`env.widgets().make` gives a placement's widget, which reads its settings
by their usual ids and gets that placement's values
(`Settings::with_placement`); a widget need do nothing for it. Screens
of their own that place widgets use `Id::placement` and forget a
placement's values when it goes (`Settings::placement_values`).

`widgets::shows(env, id, "author")` reads a part's switch,
`widgets::choice_setting` makes other choices of the widget's own, and
`widgets::draw_message` says kindly what is not there yet. A widget's
`height` counts its frame (`widgets::widget_look` gives the area inside
it without drawing). For round things there are `Canvas::fill_circle`,
`stroke_circle`, `fill_ring` (arcs, e.g. a progress ring) and
`draw_hand`, with angles as on a clock face (`paperpaw_sdk::round`);
light grays are drawn with `fill_shaded` or `fill_round_shaded`, which
dither them on black and white panels.

Screens that place widgets one below the other should know the kernel's
two widgets for room between them: `widgets::SPACE` is an ordinary
widget, a gap; `widgets::FILL` has no height of its own and takes its
share of the room the others leave (`widgets::fill_height`). Both may
be in a list more than once (`widgets::repeatable`).

### Presets

A preset is a ready-made set of setting values chosen as a whole
(`paperpaw_sdk::presets`). It has a kind, named by the plugin that
offers such presets. That plugin lists those of its kind with
`env.settings().presets().of_kind(kind)`. It works out what one changes
with `Preset::changes` and the settings it covers. It shows it with
`Command::PreviewSettings`: the values show on every screen without
being kept, until the screen that asked closes. It keeps it with
`presets::commands`. The settings of its kind that a preset leaves out
go back to their defaults.

The kinds PaperPaw's own plugins offer are themes (`core.theme`,
below) and the power modes, `core.power-mode`, which the kernel offers.
The sleep screen offers pictures over the page as `sleep.overlay`, see
[Plugins without code](#plugins-without-code). Add presets kept in the
program with `Registrar::add_presets`, a `static` list of
`Preset::fixed`. They may be of your own kind or another plugin's:

```rust
static THEMES: [Preset; 1] = [Preset::fixed(
    "my.dusk",
    presets::THEME,
    "my.dusk",      // translation keys of its name
    "my.dusk.help", // and of a sentence on it
    "core.ui-focus = core.focus.ring
core.ui-separators = core.separators.none",
)];

r.add_presets(&THEMES)?;
```

A theme is a preset of the kind `core.theme` (`presets::THEME`): values
for the appearance settings. Where any plugin brings one, the
appearance settings begin with *Theme*, which lists them; the one
chosen gives the appearance settings its values and those it leaves
out their defaults, so two themes installed never fight. A data plugin
brings themes in its `presets.ini`:

```ini
[paw]
kind = core.theme
name = Paw
description = Round and friendly: a frame for the focus, no lines.
core.ui-corners = core.corners.soft
core.ui-focus = core.focus.ring
core.ui-separators = core.separators.none
```

### Hints for a screen

The first time a screen opens, a short note over it says what its
controls do: the hints its plugin gives with `help::add`, each a text
and, where it is about a part of the screen, that part (in thousandths
of the screen's width and height), framed. A hint is for touch, for
buttons or for both; a device shows those that fit its input. A tap or
any button closes the note, and it does not come again for that screen;
*No more hints* and the settings switch them all off.

```rust
use paperpaw_sdk::help::{self, HelpHint, Zone};

help::add(r, SCREEN.as_str(), &[
    HelpHint::touch("hello.help.tap").zone(Zone::new(0, 0, 1000, 120)),
    HelpHint::buttons("hello.help.confirm"),
    HelpHint::any("hello.help.back"),
])?;
```

The texts are keys of the plugin's translations; the screen is any
screen's id, so a plugin can add hints to another's. A screen that first
prepares what it shows (the reader, opening a book) has its hints wait
with `help::wait(r, SCREEN.as_str())` and says when it is ready,
`cx.command(help::ready(&SCREEN))`: screens below another get no timers,
so it would not get ready under them. The note is the
`help` plugin's; another plugin can show them its own way, from
`help::hints(env, screen)` when `events::SCREEN_SHOWN` comes.

### Passwords and keys

Plugins keep passwords, API keys and tokens with
`Command::set_secret(SecretChange::keep(id, label, value))` and read them
with `env.secrets().get(id)`. They are all listed in *Settings, Passwords
and keys*, where the user changes or removes them. Ask for one on the
keyboard in password mode (`ask::text(…).password()`); the keyboard
offers to type it on a phone. Ask for web and e-mail addresses with
`.url()` and `.email()`: the keyboard types them as they are, without
capitals of its own. They are kept apart from the settings and
not readable at a glance, but not encrypted: the devices have no safe
place for a key. A plugin sees its own alone: name them in its
namespace (`myplugin.token`); `env.secrets().get` gives another plugin's
none, and `env.secrets().listed()` names every secret without its value.
A setting whose extra is `SettingExtra::secret()` is kept the same way. Native code is not
sandboxed and could go past this; the SDK hands no plugin another's
secret.

### The network

`Command::http(HttpRequest::get(url, &FETCHED))` makes a request where
the device has a network (`env.caps().network`); the answer comes as the
request's reply event, an `HttpReply` with the status and the body, or
saved to a file (`.save_to(path)`) for large ones. A request may set a
`timeout`, the answer's headers it wants back (`want_headers`) and the
longest body kept in memory (`max_body`, by default 64 KiB on small
devices). Every request is answered once, also when it is refused
(its `refused` says why and when to try again). The manifest says
that the plugin uses the network (`.uses(Uses::NETWORK)` in its manifest); without it,
requests are refused. In Offline (`env.power()`), only what the reader went
online for goes out: a screen that needs the network says so on itself
and offers *Go online*, which sends `Command::GoOnline` (the network for
that screen until it closes); anything else is refused with
`Reason::Offline` and may try again on `events::WORK_ALLOWED`.
`Command::CancelHttp` takes requests back. A download that may take a
while says how far it came with `.progress(&PROGRESS)`, an
`Event<HttpProgress>`: the bytes received, the size where the server
said (`permille()` for a bar), and the request's parameters, at most
every 5 % or every 2 seconds and never after the reply, so a screen
redraws its bar no more often (only the bar's area, with a partial
refresh). Downloaded into a file of the plugin's own and moved into the
library once whole, a download taken back leaves nothing there (as the
OPDS plugin does). Where a server or a computer
is told which device this is (a sync service, Calibre), the name is
`env.device_name()`: the one the reader set under *Device name*, else
the model's; a plugin never makes one of its own.

### Bluetooth

Where the device has a Bluetooth Low Energy radio the kernel uses
(`env.caps().bluetooth`; `env.bluetooth()` shows the radio's state and
the bonded devices given to the plugin), a plugin that says so in its
manifest (`.uses(Uses::BLUETOOTH)`) sends commands written with
`paperpaw_sdk::bluetooth` and hears everything about them as its own
events, each a `BtEvent` (ADR 0027). Every command is answered: by its
result, or by a `BtEvent::Failed(BtFailure)` that says which command
(`BtOp`) failed for which device and why (`BtError`: `Off`,
`NotAllowed`, `NotFound`, `Busy`, `Timeout`, `Declined`, `Lost`,
`Att(code)`, `Held(refusal)`, `Unsupported`).

Bluetooth costs battery, so everything is cheap unless asked otherwise.
The kernel switches the radio on for the first request and off a little
after the last; scans and advertising always end after a while; links
run at long intervals; and scans, links and advertising end with the
screen that asked for them (or with declared work, `Work::bluetooth`),
and all of them before the device sleeps. Where plugins ask for
different powers, the radio runs at the cheapest one that serves them
all, and the time it was on is counted (`Usage::bluetooth_ms`).

- **Scanning**: `bluetooth::scan(&FOUND).service(Uuid::sig(0x180D))
  .command()` finds devices in reach (`BtEvent::Found` with a `Device`:
  its id, name, signal, services, advertised data and kind), then
  `BtEvent::ScanEnded`. A scan lasts 10 seconds unless
  `.lasting(duration)` says otherwise (a minute at most), listens
  passively and seldom (`ScanPower::Low`; `.power(ScanPower::Balanced)`,
  `.active()` to ask devices for their names), and `.first()` ends it
  with the first device. `ScanPower::Fast` is only for the reader's own
  doing, and a plugin scans again only a minute after its last scan
  ended, unless the reader asked. A plugin hears only what passes its
  own filters.
- **A GATT client**: `connect(device, &LINK).command()` (`.power(...)`
  for shorter intervals, `.idle(duration)` to let go of the link when
  nothing was asked for that long), then `discover(device).command()`
  lists the services and their characteristics (`BtEvent::Discovered`;
  `bluetooth::characteristic(&services, service, characteristic)` finds
  one), `read`, `write(device, handle, bytes)` (`.without_response()`),
  `subscribe` to notifications (`BtEvent::Value`), or
  `subscribe_to(device, service, characteristic)`, the handle found by
  the kernel; `disconnect`.
- **Pairing**: `pair(device)` asks the reader, in the kernel's own
  question, never the plugin's; the device is then bonded and given to
  the plugin (`BtEvent::Paired`). A plugin sees only devices its scans
  found and bonded devices the reader gave it; anything else fails with
  `BtError::NotFound`. Devices are known by a `DeviceId`, never by their
  address. The Bluetooth manager, the plugin whose screen is bound to
  `slots::BLUETOOTH`, sees every bond; `forget`, `give` and `take_back`
  count otherwise only as the reader's own doing.
- **Keys of a remote or a keyboard** need no plugin: once the reader lets
  a bonded device type (`remote_keys(device, &DONE)`), its keys are
  buttons of the key maps, `button.hid.right`, `button.hid.page-down`,
  `button.hid.volume-up` and so on, bound like the device's own. Its
  link slows down a minute after the last key. A plugin the device is
  given to may ask for the reports themselves with
  `hid_reports(device, &REPORTS)`.
- **Being seen**: `advertise(&SEEN).name("…").service(uuid).command()`,
  for a minute unless `.lasting(…)` says otherwise (ten minutes at
  most), and services of the device's own GATT server declared with
  `Registrar::add_gatt_service(ServiceSpec::new(uuid, &EVENTS)
  .characteristic(CharacteristicSpec::new(uuid).read().notify()))`:
  centrals' reads (`BtEvent::ReadRequest`, answered with `respond` or
  `refuse`), writes and subscriptions come as events, and
  `notify_centrals` sends to those subscribed. Characteristics need an
  encrypted link unless `.access(Access::Open)` says otherwise.

Events written out for others (observers, rules) carry no payloads:
neither readings nor keys nor what a phone sent. A heart-rate reader:

```rust
const FOUND: Event<BtEvent> = Event::new("pulse.found");
const LINK: Event<BtEvent> = Event::new("pulse.link");
const HEART_RATE: Uuid = Uuid::sig(0x180D);
const MEASUREMENT: Uuid = Uuid::sig(0x2A37);

r.add_action(ActionSpec::new(START, "pulse.start").handler(|_, _, out| {
    out.push(bluetooth::scan(&FOUND).service(HEART_RATE).first().command());
}))?;
r.on(FOUND, |_, event: &BtEvent, out| {
    if let BtEvent::Found(device) = event {
        out.push(bluetooth::connect(device.id, &LINK).command());
    }
})?;
r.on(LINK, |_, event: &BtEvent, out| match event {
    BtEvent::Connected { device, .. } => {
        out.push(bluetooth::subscribe_to(*device, HEART_RATE, MEASUREMENT));
    }
    BtEvent::Value { bytes, .. } => {
        // Flags first; the rate is one byte, or two where flag 0 is set.
        let bpm = match bytes.as_slice() {
            [flags, low, high, ..] if flags & 1 == 1 => u16::from_le_bytes([*low, *high]),
            [_, rate, ..] => u16::from(*rate),
            _ => return,
        };
        out.push(Command::set(&BPM, i64::from(bpm)));
    }
    _ => {}
})?;
```

The emulator pretends to have Bluetooth for the X4 Pro's profile, with
made-up devices in reach: `PaperPaw Remote`, a page-turner whose keys a
script presses with `ble-key:right` (or `left`, `page-down`,
`volume-up` …) once they go to the key maps, and `Pulse HR`, a
heart-rate belt that answers the example above, notifying a rate each
second.

### Screens that run in real time

Games, emulators and animations draw many frames a second and want
every button as it goes down. Such a screen says so in one place,
[`Screen::mode`], with a `realtime::ScreenMode`
([ADR 0030](adr/0030-real-time-screens.md)):

```rust
fn mode(&self) -> ScreenMode {
    ScreenMode::new()
        .full_screen()     // no row of hints, no bars
        .raw_keys()        // buttons pressed and released, in on_key
        .cleans_itself()   // no full refresh every few pages
        .fastest()         // the fastest refresh the panel has
        .grays(2)          // black and white is enough
        .frame_every(Duration::from_millis(100))
        .awake_for(Duration::from_secs(600))
}
```

Each option asks for an intent; every device meets it as well as it
can. With `raw_keys`, `on_key` gets each button pressed and let go,
with its time, and `env.keys_held()` says which are down. The power
button stays the device's, and holding *Back* for two seconds always
leaves the screen. With `frame_every`, the screen asks for its timer as
usual (`cx.wake_at`); the X4 then goes on while the panel refreshes, and
shows the next frame as soon as the panel is free.

The device says what it can do and what it did: `env.panel()` has the
fastest time of each refresh mode as measured, its grays, and the last
frame shown (`last_frame()`: when, how long it took, how many frames
were merged into it). Pace yourself by these numbers rather than by
your own: faster panels then make your plugin faster without a new
build.

Draw pictures that change every frame with `canvas.blit`: a packed
`Bitmap` of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits a pixel with a palette of grays, at a
whole scale, dithered or not. A 160×144 picture at three times its size
costs a fraction of drawing it pixel by pixel.

Keep what a loop reads all the time in internal RAM and large data in
PSRAM (`memory::vec_in(Placement::FAST, n)` and `Placement::LARGE`);
devices with one kind of memory keep both alike. In a code plugin, mark
the few functions that run every frame with `paperpaw_sdk::hot! { … }`:
the X4 runs them from internal RAM instead of flash, a bounded part of
its heap; what does not fit runs from flash as before.

A screen that needs much memory says so (`.memory(bytes)`, and
`.needs_network()` or `.needs_bluetooth()` where it does): as it shows,
the kernel lets caches go, holds background work back, switches off
the radios it does not need, asks the screens below to let go of what
they can make again (`on_squeeze`; the reader lets its book go and
keeps its place) and closes them where that is not enough, until there
is enough, and gives everything back once it closes. Read what you got
with `env.room()` in `on_show`, and make the large buffer there. A
screen of yours that keeps much (pictures, a long list) lets it go in
`on_squeeze` and makes it again in `on_show`.

To keep the device from going to sleep by itself for a while (a clock,
a slideshow, a long download), hold it: `cx.keep_awake(WakeHold::new(id,
reason).lasting(...))` on a screen (it ends when the screen closes), or
`Command::KeepAwake` from work and services; renew it before it ends,
let go with `Command::LetSleep`. The reader can switch holds off.

`samples/frame-test` does all of this and shows what it measures (frames
a second, the work as hot and as ordinary code, the drawing, the heap):
`cargo run -p paperpaw-emulator --features frame-test`, then *Frame
test* in the tools.

### Work in the background

What a plugin does on its own, not because the reader just asked for
it, it declares as work (`paperpaw_sdk::work`, ADR 0025), and the
kernel runs it at the moment that costs least: waking, a book opened or
closed, going to sleep, the radio on anyway, charging, idle.
`Command::work(Work::network(PUSH).within(Duration::from_secs(1800))
.at_moments(Moments::BOOK_CLOSED | Moments::SLEEP))` sends the reading
position when the book is closed or the device sleeps, at the latest
after half an hour; the kernel then emits the work's event and the
plugin makes its request. `optional()` work (weather, headlines) runs
only while that is cheap, and never brings the radio on by itself.
`Work::at(event, time)` is a timer, `every` repeats, `key` tells
several works of one event apart, `Command::CancelWork` takes one back.
`env.reader()` says whether what is handled is the reader's own doing: an
action the reader ran acts at once, the same action run by a rule
declares `Work::when_cheap(id, within)` instead and waits for a good
moment.
Long work in steps (an install, a catalog walked) registers its step
function (`r.add_work(WorkSpec::new(id, title, step))`) and is stepped
between frames. `env.work()` says where a work stands, for the plugin's
own page; background work never shows a notice over reading. The power
mode (`env.power()`) makes deadlines longer or holds network work back;
most plugins need not read it.
Read large JSON answers as they stream with
`paperpaw_sdk::json::stream`, so they need little memory.
`Command::Serve` serves HTTP to the local network, e.g. for transfers
from a computer or typing on a phone; what happens to it comes as
`ServerNotice`s. A plugin answers each request with `Command::Respond`.
A server stops when the screen that started it closes. Serve only while the screen showing the
address is open, and guard it as `paperpaw_sdk::served` does: a key
drawn anew each time in the address (`served::key`), checked by a
`served::Guard`, which turns requests away for a while after a few
wrong keys. Where PaperPaw runs Wi-Fi itself (the X4s),
`paperpaw_sdk::wifi` says the radio's state, and
`WifiCommand::Host` opens a network of the device's own for a phone to
join, as the Wi-Fi transfer does without a router. In the emulator
the X4s start with the radio off, as a device does; with `--wifi
online` (over `--stdio`, `start` with `"wifi": "online"`) they start on
USB, in a network `Workshop Wi-Fi` joined before, and a plugin's
requests go out at once.

Other protocols go over sockets ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-sockets-for-plugins.md)):
`Command::Connect` opens a TCP connection, `Command::SocketSend` sends,
and `Command::SocketRead` asks for what comes next, as text
(`SocketRead::Text`) or as a file of a known length written to storage as
it comes (`SocketRead::File`), so files of any size never need to fit in
memory. `Command::Broadcast` finds services in the local network by a
UDP datagram and their answers. Everything comes back as events
(`SocketNotice`s); a socket closes when the screen
that was open as it opened closes.

### Firmware updates

Where PaperPaw is the device's firmware (the X4s), `env.firmware()` says
which version runs and how an install goes; elsewhere it is `None`.
`Command::Firmware(FirmwareCommand::Install { path, key, older })`
installs a signed update file: `key` is the key of one not signed by
PaperPaw that the reader accepted, shown its fingerprint, `older` that
they chose one not newer than the running firmware
(`firmware::Update::may_install` is the shell's check).
`FirmwareCommand::Restart` restarts into it once
`FirmwareState::Installed`; `events::FIRMWARE_CHANGED` comes on the
way. `firmware::Update::read` tells what a file holds before. The
`update` plugin does all this for update files on the card; a plugin
that fetches updates from somewhere else only needs to put the file
there.

`FirmwareCommand::InstallForeign { path }` installs another firmware's
app image instead (the way back to CrossPoint): not signed, so send it
only for a file the reader chose as such, told that it is not PaperPaw.
`firmware::ForeignImage::read` and `fits` tell what the file is before;
the shell checks the whole image as it writes it (`ForeignCheck`: its
chip, segments, checksum and hash, and CrossPoint's board tag).
